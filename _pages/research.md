<h2>Confined liquids and glasses</h2>
<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td>Liquids confined to small spaces display complex behaviour. One key feature is that the density of the liquid is not uniform, and varies with the distance from the confining walls. A remarkable property of these liquids is that the degree of ordering among the particles varies non-monotonically with the degree of confinement. Following from this, the glass transition also shows a non-monotonic dependence on confinement length. My research seeks to disentangle these two features.<br />
    <br />
    The first approach is to study a quasi-confined liquid, where the liquid is confined to the surface of a (4D) torus. In this homogenous system, the density is uniform, allowing us to investigate whether the non-monotonic structural properties are independent of it.<br />
    <br />
    The second approach is to study a liquid which is not confined, but instead, a field is applied to the particles to impose a modulated density externally. Complementary to the torus approach, this allows us to investigate the effect of density modulation independently of intrinsic confinement. I aim to characterize the glass transition in the system, and compare it to that in confined liquids.</td>

    <td>Liquids in crowded environments occur in many situations, including inside of cells, in catalysts, and in porous rock during oil recovery. Both experimentally, and in simple models, the transport in complex crowded media can be subdiffusive. This is termed anomalous transport, and is slower than the normal diffusion process. The origin of this anomalous diffusion has been explained theoretically for the simple Lorentz model. I extend the Lorentz model towards realistic systems by relaxing one assumption of the model (the hard-exclusion interaction), and find that they system exhibits a percolation transition dependent on the energy of the probe particle, and the dynamics remain anomalous at the percolation point.

<H2>Experimentally realisable spin models</H2>
<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td>Simple models are used extensively by physicist to underlying physical processes of real systems. Ising type models, which consist of a number of interacting spins each with one degree of freedom, are particularly popular. Recent advances in lithography of nanomagnets has allowed such toy models to be built and imaged experimentally. In collaboration with experimentalists, I change the geometry of the lattice, to investigate in detail some of the more interesting physical effects also observed in typical physical systems, like charge screening and frustration.</td>

    <td>Metamaterials are characterized by their function depending heavily on their geometry, rather than their composition. One example of these, called “auxetic”, have the counter-intuitive behaviour of expanding laterally when stretched longitudinally. Porous solids, such as polymer or metallic foams, are examples of man made auxetic materials. These architected materials are designed with a re-entrant cell structure. Simple two dimensional models with re-entrant geometries have successfully reproduced this auxetic behaviour. We investigate the effect of disorder in the structure, and how it influences the auxetic properties.</td>
